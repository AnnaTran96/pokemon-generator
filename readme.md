# Pokémon Generator

I have created a Pokémon Generator that will generate a random pokemon using both a REST API and [Pokémon's API](https://pokeapi.co/).

Currently, this is designed to work on a large tablet or desktop. However, I will continue to work on this to make it responsive on all devices.

## Instructions

Use `npm install` 

Then use `npm start` to start the server.

Feel free to use Nodemon. If you do, the command line is: `nodemon ./server/server.js`.

Now you are ready to use the Pokémon Generator.

Alternatively, you can use this generator via this [link](https://annatran96.github.io/pokemon-generator/).

## Improvements Pending

I am still in the process of:

- Making it responsive
- Running more tests
- Getting my Pokémon quotes to display
- Possibly switching the photos to use only Pokémon's API .png links so when this repo is forked and cloned, it won't take too much memory on your desktop.
